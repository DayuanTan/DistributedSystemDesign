# CMSC621_OS

This is a repostory for UMBC CMSC621 Operating System class projects.

## Project 1 (Python) - **Socket**. Create a new thread for each client connection. 

Requirement is [here](Project1.pdf)

# My proj1 report is [here](DayuanTan_proj1.pdf)

## Project 2 (Java) - Implementing a **distributed system** with load balancer.

In our design, we were aiming to set up a **distributed system** providing a set of web services
with at least **five nodes**. There should be some centralized nodes that could collect all the
web services provided by the system. Each of the web services should be provided by
multiple sites at the same time, and client requests should be evenly forwarded to each
server. In our final deployment, we set up a system with **two central servers** and **four servers**.
We combined the service discovery and **load balancing mechanisms** into each central
server. The system also provided automatic failure sensing and correction. The results of
testing experiments showed an average response time of 90 milliseconds together with the
proof of scalability and reliability.

# Important Notice for Registered Students:
<p>
If your assignment/project is similar to this repo, this would be a good learning resources for you. One suggest is you go through this repo then close it when you write your own solution, and reference it correctly. 
    
You are highly recommended to check your university/department/professor's rules about referring to internet resources. If there isn't a specific rule, you are highly recommended to ask your professor to elaborate it. Do they have open-internet policy? Do they ask for listing references at the end of your report only, or indicating exactly which parts/blocks of your code re-use which references? Do they require the re-used code from internet sources cannot exceed a specific percentage of your whole submission?
    
If your submisssion was similar with anyone else's, this would be a very bad situation in almost all universties. You should definitely avoid this.
