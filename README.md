### Implementing a distributed system.

In our design, we were aiming to set up a distributed system providing a set of web services
with at least five nodes. There should be some centralized nodes that could collect all the
web services provided by the system. Each of the web services should be provided by
multiple sites at the same time, and client requests should be evenly forwarded to each
server. In our final deployment, we set up a system with two central servers and four servers.
We combined the service discovery and load balancing mechanisms into each central
server. The system also provided automatic failure sensing and correction. The results of
testing experiments showed an average response time of 90 milliseconds together with the
proof of scalability and reliability.
